# PatternHW
Program is designed for GoF pattern usage in action:
- it uses AbstractFactory pattern to construct three types on ArmyUnits(Infantry, Vehicle and Aircraft) with basic cost
- ArmyUnits can be decorated with some equipment (DecoratorPattern) adding cost to ArmyUnit
- there is procedure to "prepare Unit" -  make unit "training" and "make an oath" - TemplatePattern
- when the army is created - colonel informs  General and President(ObserverPattern) + total price of army
- to "start action" on all stuff - FacadePattern is used

Enjoy!
